grits-ros-pkg
=============

This is the official [GRITS Lab](http://www.gritslab.gatech.edu) [ROS](http://ros.org) repository. It contains our in-house ROS packages for

+ AR.Drone (Quadrotor)
+ Arduino (Microcontroller)
+ Khepera III (Mobile Robot)
+ Optitrack (Motion Capture)
+ Vicon (Motion Capture)

*Note*: These packages have been tailored to our lab's research and demos, but should be usable outside of our lab with little or no modifications. The `master` branch is reserved for our tested and stable codebase, while `development` or any other branches may be unstable derivatives of the stable codebase.

[Jean-Pierre de la Croix](http://jpdelacroix.com/#contact) and Yancy Diaz-Mercado are the current maintainers of this repository.
